# Strange Attractors
Quick and dirty python code to display 2 types of strange attractors. I decided I wanted to work with strange attractors after reading *Chaos: Making a New Science* by James Gleick. Matplotlib's 3d graphs were too slow, so I looked into using a new graphing library. I found Plotly (which I found to produce a lot cleaner looking graphs) and threw together some code to show the Lorenz and RÃ¶ssler strange attractors which are incredibly interesting and beautiful plots. The idea of having something of infinite length within a finite space is really mind-boggling. The one thing I was having trouble getting to work was the range for annimations so for now it dynamically changes as the annimation plays out. Here are the images I produced:
